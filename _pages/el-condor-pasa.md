### El Condor Pasa

```
          Simon and Garfunkel: El Condor Pasa
          
    Em                         G
I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
                                  Em
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
 
 C
Away, I'd rather sail away
       G
Like a swan that's here and gone
  C
A man gets tied up to the ground
             G
He gives the world its saddest sound
             Em
It's saddest sound
 
Em                            G
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
                                       Em
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would
 
 C
Away, I'd rather sail away
       G
Like a swan that's here and gone
  C
A man gets tied up to the ground
             G
He gives the world its saddest sound
             Em
It's saddest sound
 
Em                            G
I'd rather be a forest than a street
                                  Em
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
 
 C
Away, I'd rather sail away
       G
Like a swan that's here and gone
  C
A man gets tied up to the ground
             G
He gives the world its saddest sound
             Em
It's saddest sound
 
                                     G
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
                                       Em
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would
 
 C
Away, I'd rather sail away
       G
Like a swan that's here and gone
  C
A man gets tied up to the ground
             G
He gives the world its saddest sound
             Em
It's saddest sound
