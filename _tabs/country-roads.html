          John Denver: Take Me Home Country Roads
          
[Verse 1]

A            F#m            E                        D        A
 Almost Heaven; West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
A                  F#m                    E
 Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains,
 D             A
Blowin' like a breeze.

[Chorus]

        A             E           F#m        D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
        A              E            D            A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Verse 2]

A              F#m               E                D             A
 All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
A                F#m                 E
 Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine,
 D           A
Teardrop in my eye.

[Chorus]

        A             E           F#m        D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
        A              E            D            A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Bridge]

F#m            E           A
   I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me,
   D       A            E
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
   F#m               G           D
And driving down the road I get a feeling
      A                    E                E7
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.

[Chorus]

        A             E           F#m        D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
        A              E            D            A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
        A             E           F#m        D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
        A              E            D            A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
        E                 A             E                 A
Take me home, down country roads; take me home, down country roads
