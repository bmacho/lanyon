          Juga: Oh, Capablanca
          
            Am         Am
They played Caro-Kanns,
              G         G
their ratings were higher
         Dm       Dm
but from move ten and twelve
         E         E7
the kingsides were ours.

(Am G Dm E E7)
Trade some pieces fast
the rooks were in hands
and their almighty queens,
were also in .. hands.

(Am G Dm E E7)
Our kings safe and solid
While their kings both were naked
with the time pressure we'll crush them
inevitable fate.

(Am G Dm E E7)
We then sac'd some heavy
but that don't mean a thing
we were both attacking
one of us will win!

(Am G F / Am G Dm / G F Am) 
Oh our dear Capablancos
where did our attacks go?
We were clearly winning
2 seconds ago, 2 seconds ago.
2 seconds ago.

(Am G Dm E E7)
Shook their hands signed the score
politely as we could.
We can't analyse
chess dot-com is shit.

(Am G Dm E E7)
A lonely hotel room
We argued all night 
Only thing we aggreed
That our partner sucks

(Am G F / Am G Dm / G F Am) 
Oh our dear Capablancos
where did our attacks go?
We were clearly winning
2 seconds ago, 2 seconds ago.
2 seconds ago.

But our dear Capablancas
you tell us
we learn more from our defeats
who needs victories, right?
