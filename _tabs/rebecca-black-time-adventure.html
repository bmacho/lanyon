          Rebecca Black: Time Adventure

Fmaj7 Am7 Fmaj7 C7

Fmaj7                          Am7
Time is an illusion that helps things make sense
Fmaj7                          Cmaj7
So we are always living in the present tense
Fmaj7                       Cm7
It seems unforgiving when a good thing ends
    Fmaj7                    Am7
But you and I will always be back then
Fmaj7                    Cmaj7
You and I will always be back then

Singing
Fmaj7        Cmaj7
Will happen, happening happened
Fmaj7        D7
Will happen, happening happened
Fmaj7              D7
And we will happen again and again
       Fmaj7                    Am7
'Cause you and I will always be back then
Fmaj7                 Cmaj7
You and I will always be back then


[Bridge]
Gm                            C7
    If there was some amazing force outside of time 
   Fmaj7                    Dm            
To take us back to where we were
    Gm                       C7
And hang each moment up like pictures on the wall
   Fmaj7              Dm
Inside a billion tiny frames 
                      Dm Dm7
So that we can see it all, all, all

[Outro]
It would look like
Will happen, happening happened
Will happen, happening happened
And there we are again and again
'Cause you and I will always be back then
You and I will always be back then
Will happen, happening happened
Will happen, happening happened
And there we are again and again
'Cause you and I will always be back then
You and I will always be back then
You and I will always be back then
You and I will always be back then
That's why
You and I will always be best friends
