[Intro]
Bm
Climbing up this mountain
 
Climbing up twice
Bm
Hoping that I make it this time
                     D
But I'm so done with hoping
       A       F#m
Cause hoping is to failing is to
 
[Verse]
Bm
Falling down this mountain
 
Falling down again
      Bm
Boom, boom
 
Heart beats still beating in the end
     D
I'm choking
     A                    F#m
But that's just what they wanted
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm
So I get up off the ground
Bm
And I shake it out
Bm
Ra da da
Bm
Come, look at me now
Bm
Look at me now
 
G
I'm not here to talk
 
I'm not here to talk
A
I'm just here to walk
        A (strum once)
Here to walk the walk
 
[Chorus]
D
I'm gonna make it up this mountain
Make it to the top
G
Show them what I'm made of
 
Show them what I've got
 
Bm
I will, I will, I will
 
I will, I will, I will
G
So mark my words
Before you swallow yours
 
D
I'm gonna make it up this mountain
Make it to the top
G
Show them what I'm made of
 
Show them what I've got
 
Bm
I will, I will, I will
 
I will, I will, I will
G
So mark my words
           Em                  F#m
Before you swallow yours just like a pill
 
[Verse]
Bm
Started as a question
 
Ended as a fact
Bm
When I found out I'm the only one that has my back
    D
I'm drowning
       A           F#m
Cause they fill my lungs with venom
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm
And the sharks are coming out
Bm
And they're hungry now, ra da da
Bm
Sharks are coming out
Bm (strum once)
I put them out
 
[Chorus]
          D
I'm gonna make it up this mountain
Make it to the top
G
Show them what I'm made of
Show them what I've got
 
Bm
I will, I will, I will
 
I will, I will, I will
G
So mark my words
 
Before you swallow yours
 
          D
I'm gonna make it up this mountain
 
Make it to the top
G
Show them what I'm made of
G (strum once)
Show them what I've got
 
Bm
I will, I will, I will
 
I will, I will, I will
G
So mark my words
           Em                 F#m
Before you swallow yours just like a pill

Ay, before you swallow yours just like a pill

Ay, before you swallow yours just like a pill
 
Em                    G
I will, I will, I... I
G                            D            Bm
So mark my words before you swallow yours
