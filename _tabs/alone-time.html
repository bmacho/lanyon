[Intro]
G E Am D x2

[Verse]
            G
There's not much here for me
            E
When I'm here I don't feel free
             Am
But when I'm there I feel alive
           D
It's what I need to survive

      G
No offense you're all great
       E
But it really is too late
             Am
To change my personality
          D
It's just my reality

      G
And I do not blame you
        E
For questioning what I do
           Am
It doesn't matter
     E              Am            
Well technically it matters to me 
       D                   G
But it shouldn't matter to you

(G)                        E                 Am
I don't need any substance in order to feel high
             D               G             D
I can't stop you from asking why
G                             E
Why I choose to live this way
                        Am
It's no one's fault but mine
    E                Am
And trust me I'll be fine
           D               G       C  G  D
As long as I have my alone time
         G       C  G  D
My alone time


B Em E Am D B Em E Am D


[Verse]
             G
I'm still in love with myself
        E
With my purpose with my health
             Am
And with the goal I have in mind
         D
Just the thought helps me unwind

        G
I don't doubt you're the same
        E
Picture with a different frame
             Am
If you won't tell I will not ask
         D
What you hide behind the mask

           G
I don't really have a clue
        E
Despite what I think is true
           Am
I'm so pretentious
      E             Am
While I might be pretentious
          D                   G
I'm still no better than you


[Chorus]
G                         E                 Am
I don't need any substance in order to feel high
             D               G
I can't stop you from asking why
G
Why I choose to live this way
E                       Am
It's no one's fault but mine
    E                Am
And trust me I'll be fine
           D               G    C  G  D
As long as I have my alone time
        G   C  G  D
My alone time


[Bridge]
B
When I'm all alone
Em            E
When I'm on my own
           Am                           D
It doesn't matter what I do
B
Because no matter what
Em         E
As long as that door's shut
Am                      D
Not once do I wish that I could be like you


G E Am D G D G E Am E Am D


[Verse]
      G
Sadly I know it's wrong
      E
And I knew it all along
       Am
I just thought it would be nice
       D
To not have to pay the price
        G
You are someone I adore
            E
What do you think I'm alive for
              Am
But you're an individual
         D
You have your own schedule
       G
We are both mostly free
           E
There's so many sights to see
         Am
It isn't worth it
  E                Am
I mean it might be worth it
       D                    G
If the sights could come to me
           G
I won't pretend I'm perfect
E            Am
I'm not even close
                D               G
I've screwed up more often than most
           G
But in our darkest moments

[Outro]
  E               Am
Together we'll be fine
      E               Am
We'll help each other climb
     E                   Am
I'll help you reach your prime
     E                  F
I'll make sure you can find me
         D                  G    C  D  G
When I'm done with my alone time
