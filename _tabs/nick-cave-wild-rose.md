           Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds : Where The Wild Roses Grow
           
[Chorus]
 
         Em               Am Em             G              B
   They call me the wild rose,      But my name was Eliza Day
             Em                    Am Em             Em        D   Em
   Why they call me that I do not know,      For my name was Eliza Day
 
 
[Verse]
 
             Em                         G
   From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
         Am                    B
   She stared in my eyes and smiled
        Em                           G
   Her lips were the colour of the roses
         Am                          B
   That grew down the river,  All bloody and wild
 
             Em                        G
   When he knocked on my door,  And entered the room
         Am                  B
   My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
            Em                      G
   He would be my first man,   And with a careful hand
       Am                       B                 B
   He wiped up the tears, That ran down my face
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         Em               Am Em              G              B
   They call me the wild rose,       But my name was Eliza Day
             Em                    Am Em           Em        D   Em
   Why they call me that I do not know,    For my name was Eliza Day
 
 
[Verse]
 
            Em                              G
   On the second day,     I brought her a flower
                   Am                  B
   She was more beautiful,  Than any woman I'd seen
      Em                           G
   I said do you know,  Where the wild roses grow
  Am                         B
   So sweet and scarlet and free
 
            Em                          G
   On the second day he came,  With a single red rose
              Am                          B
   He said,  Give me your loss and your sorrow
         Em                 G
   I nodded my head,  As I lay on the bed
         Am                         B       B
   If I show you the roses will you follow
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         Em               Am Em             G              B
   They call me the wild rose,      But my name was Eliza Day
             Em                    Am Em           Em        D   Em
   Why they call me that I do not know,    For my name was Eliza Day
 
 
[Verse]
 
           Em                           G
   On the third day he took me to the river
       Am                            B
   He showed me the roses,  And we kissed
            Em                           G
   And the last thing I heard,  Was a muttered word
      Am                        B
   As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist
 
           Em                              G
   On the last day I took her,  Where the wild roses grow
          Am                           B
   As she lay on the bank,  The wind light as a thief
           Em                            G
   And I kissed her goodbye,  Said all beauty must die
          Am                       B                B
   And I leant down and planted a rose 'tween her teeth
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         Em               Am Em            G              B
   They call me the wild rose,     But my name was Eliza Day
             Em                    Am Em           Em        D   Em
   Why they call me that I do not know,    For my name was Eliza Day
      Em         D   Em                Em        D   Em
   My name was Eliza Day,      For my name was Eliza Day
