[Intro]
E  B  C#m  B
 
E                                    B
Save me, I'm drowning so deep in the darkness. 
                              A
I'm waiting for your touch to stop this.
                                   B
There's smoke blinding us with goodbyes. 
 
And I
E                                              B
keep hope. 'Cause this feeling's different and I know,
                               A
I've staggered so long that it can't go.
                      B
Alleviate me, I'll be fine. 
 
In time.
 
E
Please remember that I miss you.
B
Young and reckless, what did we do? 
C#m
Broken promise, gone forever. 
B
Maybe one day we'll get better. 
E
Right by your side, that's where I'll be. 
B
In a heart beat if you ask me. 
C#m
Let's stay strangers like we're meant to. 
B                           E
Oh, I wonder if you miss me too.
 
[Post-Chorus]
E  B  C#m  B
 
E                                         B
Find me, I'm waiting right here where you left me. 
                                    A
Still shredded and bruised, but I'm breathing. 
                              B
Be brave for me, ignore their eyes. 
 
Just try.
      E                                           B
We're dancers, and I've picked petals looking for answers,
                                   A
and I've received these edges from chances. 
                       B
Indelible, but I'll be fine. 
 
In time.
E
Please remember that I miss you. 
B
Not caring is so hard to do. 
C#m
Everything we loved together, 
B
it's not the same without you there. 
E
Feels like you were just beside me. 
B
How did time go by so quickly? 
C#m
Now we're strangers, but I miss you. 
B                           E
Oh, I wonder if you miss me too. 
 
[Post-Chorus]
E  B  C#m  B
(Woah-oh-ohoh)
 
[Scratch21]
E
Please remember, don't forget me. 
B
I'll be leaving this heart empty. 
C#m
Burn our bridge, are you still there? 
B
All these endless circles do nothing. 
E
And I don't know, why I can't just let you go. 
B
Can we go back? Can we start again? 
C#m
Because I need you. 
B                           E
Oh, I wonder if you need me too.
 
[EileMonty]
E
Please remember, I still think of you and I. 
B
Tell me what does this all mean? 
C#m
Are you even still there? 
B
These circles do nothing. 
E
And remember, I've been waiting. 
B
Ever since this started aching. 
C#m
Now we're strangers, but I need you. 
B                           E
Oh, I wonder if you need me too.
