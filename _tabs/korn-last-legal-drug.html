Put your hand against your skin
Rub it gently to begin
You feel it?
Can you feel it?
When does pleasure become pain?
When does sex become insane?
You say yes
As you feel it


[Verse 1]
Dm        Am
When you cum
Am         Am
(Be a good girl)
Dm          Am
Hold your breathe
Am         Am
(Make it last long)
Dm      Am
It's a mess
Am         Am
(it is called)
Dm         Am     E7
the little death, girl
 
[Chorus]
Dm     Dm
  So please
Am           Am
When you die could you scream?
Dm     Dm
  Mercy
Am        Am
Mercy for you and me
Dm      Dm 
  Its true
Am            Am
What they say fuck it boy
Dm         Dm     E7      E
Love might be the last legal drug

Dm      Dm
  So please
Am           Am
When you cry let it flow
Dm     Dm
  I might
Am             Am
Make you stay, let you go
Dm       Dm
  It's true
Am            Am
What they say fuck it boy
E7         E7     E       E
Love might be the last legal drug

[intro]
Push that one more time that's all
And the rain begins to fall
You feel it?
Can you feel it?
People who ain't seen shit been
Telling you that its a sin
You say it
As you feel it
 
[Verse 1] ( When you come, Dm Am / Am Am )
 
[Chorus]  ( So please, Dm Dm / Am Am )
 
Le petite mort
 
[Chorus]  ( So please, Dm Dm / Am Am )
