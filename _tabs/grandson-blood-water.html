          grandson: Blood Water

[Refrain]
  Am
We'll never get free
  Dm
Lamb to the slaughter
  C
What you gon' do
               E
When there's blood in the water

Am Dm C E
The price of your greed
Is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do
When there's blood in the water


[Verse 1]

Am Dm C E
Look me in my eyes
Tell me everything's not fine

Am Dm C E
Or the people ain't happy
And the river has run dry

Am Dm C E
You thought you could go free
But the system is done for

Am Dm C E
If you listen here closely
There's a knock at your front door


[Refrain]

Am Dm C E
We'll never get free...

                           Am   C   F   E
When there's blood in the
                           Am   C   F   E
When there's blood in the


[Verse 2]

Am Dm C E
Beg me for mercy
Admit you were toxic

Am Dm C E
You poisoned me just for
Another dollar in your pocket

Am Dm C E
Now I am the violence
I am the sickness

Am Dm C E
Won't accept your silence
Beg me for forgiveness


[Refrain]
Am Dm C E
We'll never get free...

Am C F E
When there's blood in the water


[Bridge]
Am G F#

I am the people
I am the storm

I am the riot
I am the swarm

When the last tree's fallen
The animal can't hide

Money won't solve it
What's your alibi? (x3)

Am    C   F   E
What you gon' do when there's blood in the blood in the water?
When there's blood in the water
When there's blood in the
                           Am
When there's blood in the water
