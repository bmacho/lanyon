          Juga: Oh, Capablanca
          
          Am         Am
He played Caro-Kann,
           G         G
his rating was higher
         Dm      Dm
but from move seventeen
         E        E7
the kingside was mine.

(Am G Dm E E7)
Took my chances fast
my rook was a knife
and my almighty queen,
a beast on H-six.

(Am G Dm E E7)
My bishop was gold
his bishop was small
with no time pressure I'd crush him
once and for all.

(Am G Dm E E7)
I gave up my good knight
but that don't mean a thing
he has more experience
but I won't lose again.

Am     G         F (without the low strings??)
Oh my dear Capablanco
Am      G      Dm 
Wishful eyes deceive me
G   F    Am
overoptimistic
              Am
got nowhere to go, 
			  ??
got nowhere to go.

(Am G Dm E E7)
Shook his hand signed the score
politely as I could.
I can't analyse
can't look in his eyes.

(Am G Dm E E7)
A lonely hotel room
I cried my despair
did I allow any counterplay?
his pieces were dead.

(Am G Dm E E7)
I gave up my good knight
but that don't mean a thing
he has more experience
but I won't lose again.

(Am G F / Am G Dm / G F Am) 
Oh my dear Capablanca
where did my attack go?
I was clearly winning
2 minutes ago, 2 minutes ago.
2 minutes ago.
 
Now, according to Stockfish
I got it all wrong
after slightly advantage
I had nothing.
 
But my dear Capablanca
you tell me
we learn more from our defeats
who needs victories, right?
