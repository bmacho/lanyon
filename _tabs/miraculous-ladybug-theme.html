Em C Am D

Em              C             Am                   D
 In the daytime, I'm Marinette. Just a normal girl, with a normal life.
Em                                  C                Am               D
 But there's something about me that no one knows yet. Cause I have a secret.

Em          C
 Another day, I'm back at school
Am             D
 I think about her, she's so cool
Em              C
 She looks at me, I look away
Am            D
 But does she see me anyway?

Em
Oh oh oh
C
She's got me spinning round
Am
Oh oh oh
D
My feet are off the ground
Em
Oh oh oh
C
And when the sun goes down
Am              D
That's when I become...

D          Em               C               Am                   D
   Miraculous! Simply the best! Up to the test when things go wrong!
        Em           C                  Am              D
Miraculous! The luckiest! The power of love always so strong! 

Em         C
 I am a cat, just chilling out
Am                D
 But in the night, you're all I think about
Em               C
 I feel so strong, when you're around
Am              D
 You pick me up when I am down



Em
Oh oh oh
C
Oh no, you'll never know
Am
Oh oh oh
D
My love can only grow
Em
Oh oh oh
C
And when I see you smile
Am                D
That's when you become...

D          Em               C               Am                   D
   Miraculous! Simply the best! Up to the test when things go wrong!
        Em           C                  Am              D

Em
Oh oh oh
C
He's got me spinning round
Am
Oh oh oh
D
My feet are off the ground
Em
Oh oh oh
C
And when the sun goes down
Am              D
That's when I become...

       Em               C               Am                   D
